# STAT 601 ‚Äì Time Series Analysis Project 1 (R Markdown)

This repository contains my first Time Series Analysis project for **STAT 601** at **South Dakota State University**.  
It was completed entirely in **R Markdown**, integrating code, plots, and written interpretations for time series concepts.

## üìò Project Overview

The Project explores real-world time series datasets and applies statistical techniques using the **fpp3** framework.  
Topics covered include:

1. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - GAFA Stock Prices (AAPL, AMZN, FB, GOOG)
   - Victoria Electricity Demand

2. **Quarterly Data Conversion & Plotting**
   - Transformation to `tsibble` objects  
   - Faceted time series visualization

3. **GDP per Capita Analysis**
   - Computation and comparison across 263 countries  
   - Identification of yearly GDP leaders (1960‚Äì2017)

4. **Decomposition & Seasonality**
   - Classical multiplicative decomposition  
   - X-11 decomposition for Gas production

5. **Moving Average Equivalence**
   - Demonstrating the 3√ó5 MA = 7-term weighted MA identity

6. **Covariance Identity Proof**
   - Mathematical derivation using the linearity of expectation
